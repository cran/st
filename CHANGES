		CHANGES IN fdrtool VERSION 1.0.0


This is the first standalone release (31 August 2006).

This package implements the "shrinkage t" statistics described
in Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2006).  It also offers a convenient
interface to a number of other regularized t-type statistics often
used in high-dimensional case-control studies.
